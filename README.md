# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. We are to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data will need to be processed to fit machine learning models. The model chosen is unsupervised learning and in order to group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm will be used. Visualizations will be used to share findings.
